# init (19 School 42 network)
Project covers the basics of system administration and proposes a lot of small tasks divided into three groups:
* network
* system
* scripts

All the tasks related to Unix system administration. Some of them were tested on Debian virtual machine and couldn't be done on macos.

See the [subject](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/6378/init.en.pdf) to get more information about the problems to solve. The solutions are usually represented by a shell script
or commands.
